# Build using a Boost Docker Development Environment container.
# The BDDE project at https://github.com/jeking3/bdde includes

# integration, for example you can build in a big-endian environment
# on Travis CI.
#
# In your .travis.yml file, set the BDDE_OS and BDDE_ARCH according
# to the instructions in the BDDE README.
