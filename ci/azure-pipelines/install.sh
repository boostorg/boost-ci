# Executes the install phase for Azure Pipelines (AzP)
#
# This was ported from ci/travis/install.sh following
# this official guide:
# https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/migrate/from-travis
#
# If your repository has additional directories beyond
# "example", "examples", "tools", and "test" then you
# can add them in the environment variable DEPINST.
# i.e. - DEPINST="--include dirname1 --include dirname2"
#
# AzP requires to run special task in order to export
# SELF and BOOST_ROOT as job-scoped variable from a script.
# Follow invocation of this install.sh in .azure-pipelines.yaml
# with these two lines:
#
#  set +x
#  echo "##vso[task.setvariable variable=SELF]$SELF"
#  echo "##vso[task.setvariable variable=BOOST_ROOT]$BOOST_ROOT"
#  set -x
#
# NOTE: The set +x is required! See the troubleshooting guide:
# https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/troubleshooting#variables-having--single-quote-appended
